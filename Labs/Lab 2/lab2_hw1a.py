# Problem 1: Many people keep time using a 24 hour clock (11 is 11am and 23 is 11pm, 0 is midnight). 
# If it is currently 13 and you set  # your alarm to go off in 50 hours, it will be 15 (3pm). 
# Write a Python program to solve the general version of the above problem. 
# Ask the user for the time now (in hours), and then ask for the number of hours to wait for the alarm. 
# Your program should output what the time will be on the clock when the alarm goes off.

# We will test your code using 5 different tests. Here are the inputs for 3 of them. 
# Test cases: (current time in hours, delay in hours)
#1. (2,6)
#2. (14,6)
#3. (3,23)





# Problem 2: Take the sentence: "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy". 
#Store each word in a separate variable, then print out the sentence on one line using print.





# Problem 3: Write a program that will compute MPG for a car. 
# Prompt the user to enter the number of miles driven and the number of gallons used. Print a nice message with the answer.
#Test cases: (miles driven, gallons of gas used)
#1. (200,10)
#2. (480.5,15.5)
#3. (709.7,15.1)






# Problem 4: Write a program that will convert degrees celsius to degrees fahrenheit.
#Test cases: (degrees Celsius)
#1. (100)
#2. (37)
#3. (0)





# Problem 5: Write a program that will convert degrees fahrenheit to degrees celsius.
# Test cases: (degrees Fahrenheit)
#1. (212)
#2. (98.6)
#3. (32)
