So for example if the input is ' `Happy days are here again!`' your function should return the list `['a''d','e','g','h','i','n','p','r','s','y']` For this part write your function *without* using list comprehensions."

    "**Scrabble Help** In this problem you will write functions that create useful lists when playing scrabble. The file [wordlist.txt](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~cannon/1002/wordlist.txt) contains contains a large list of words. It is from [this](https://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/wordlist.html) website. Some of these words have punctuation in them and so they are not useful in Scrabble. For this part you will create a function that creates a copy of a file that converts any uppercase letters to lowercase and excludes any lines that include any non-letters (this means no punctuation, spaces, or numbers allowed!). More formally, your function, `convert_list`, takes two strings as parameters. The first string is the input file name and the second is the output file name. After running your function the output file must be a copy of the input file except any lines that have non-letter characters in it should be removed. In addition any uppercase letters sould be changed to lowercase letters in the new file.  \n",
