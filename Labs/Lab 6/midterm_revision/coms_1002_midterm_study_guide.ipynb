    "\n",
    "Python provides several built-in data types, each useful for different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`int`**: Represents whole numbers.\n",
    "- **`float`**: Represents decimal numbers.\n",
    "- **`str`**: Represents text (strings of characters).\n",
    "- **`bool`**: Represents Boolean values (`True` or `False`).\n",
    "- **`list`**: A mutable collection of items (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these types has specific properties and behaviors. Knowing how to work with them is key to solving many programming problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10          # int\n",
    "pi = 3.14       # float\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"  # str\n",

    "#### Populating Lists Using Multiplication and Loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create lists with repeated values using multiplication, or populate lists dynamically using loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# using multiplication\n",
    "my_list = [0] * 5  # creates a list of five zeros\n",
    "print(my_list)  # outputs: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "# using a loop\n",
    "my_list = []\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    my_list.append(i)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # outputs: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List Slicing Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "List slicing syntax: `list[start:end]`, where `start` is the index to begin slicing (inclusive) and `end` is the index to stop (exclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",
    "print(my_list[1:4])  # outputs: [20, 30, 40]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List Comprehension Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehension syntax: `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`, where `expression` is the item or transformation of the item, `iterable` is the collection being looped over, and `condition` (optional) filters items.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(6)]\n",
    "print(squares)  # outputs: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "\n",
    "even_numbers = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "print(even_numbers)  # outputs: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n",
    "```\n",

    "squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(6)]\n",
    "print(squares)  # outputs: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",

    "- Break down complex expressions into smaller steps to isolate issues.\n",
